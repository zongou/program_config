two parts: queuing and executing
commands:
	multi
	set key1 value1
	set key2 value2
	exec/discard
	
error when queuing,all steps in queue will not execute
	multi
	set b1 v1
	set b2 v2
	set b3
	exec
	
error when executing, only the wrong step will not execute
	multi
	set c1 v1
	incr c1
	set c2 v2
	exec
	
depressed lock, use lock to queue operating, java

optimistic lock, use git version like version control, get version before operation, if version match then operate, redis
example:
	session1:
		set balance 100
		watch balance
		multi
		incrby balance 10
	session2:
		watch balance
		multi
		incrby balance 20
	session1:
		exec
	session2:
		exec
	
	#session2 will fail, to unwatch, use command 'unwatch'
