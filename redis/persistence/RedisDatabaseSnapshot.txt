#config rdb dir
search: 'dir /', default is '/var/lib/redis'

config save rdb snapchat to disk, save and bgsave
search 'save', 'bgsave' in config file

'save' saves manually, all process blocked, not recommanded
'bgsave' saves asynchronized in the background, could response requests from clients

'flushall' will generate an empty database file
'stop-writes-on-bg-error', when disk is full, stop writting, enabling is recommanded
'rdbcompression', to compress rdb
'rdbchecksum', to check if rdb file is complete or broken, reduce 10% performance, but recommanded

# the process the generate rdb
create a new fork sub process to copy data to a tmporarily file, then replace, in order to improve security

rdb will lost some data after last persistence just like snapchat of virtualmachine

# test rdb
config: save 30 10			# check every 30 seconds, if key changes is more than 10 within 30s, save snapshot, this save the 10 key changes, and reset count 

usage:
cli1:redis: mset k1 v1 k2 v2 ... k12 v12		# wait unitl time is up
cli1:redis: dbsize
cli2: cp dump.rdb dump.rdb.bak			# backup, use another session only to copy snapshot
cli1:redis: shutdown					# shutdown, service redis-server stop,
										# ('kill -p PID' not working, seems its protectd)
cli1:redis: exit
cli1: cp dump.rdb.bak dump.rdb			# restore
cli1: service redis-server restart
cli1: keys *							# shuld be only first 10 keys
