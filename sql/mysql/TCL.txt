TCL - Transaction Control Language
ACID:
    Atomicity
    Consistency
    Isolation
    Durability

start a new session
    under going session:
        insert, update, delete..
    font session:
        # check autocommit
        # show variables like 'autocommit'
        # autocommit default status is off
        set autocommit=0 # turn off autocommit
        start transaction # optional

        insert ...
        update ...
        delete ...

        rollback/commit


problems of pararell transaction:
    dirty read: read the updated data that other session have not committed;
    unrepeatable read: output different data in the same transaction;
    viual read: read the data that other session inserted but have not committed;


                    [dirty read]    [unrepeatable read]     [visual read]
read uncommitted        yes                 yes                 yes
read committed          no                  yes                 yes
repeatable read         no                  no                  yes
serializable            no                  no                  no



#check isolation level

#set isolation level
# need to do that in every session
# oracle supports READ COMMITED, SERIALIZABLE, by default is READ COMMITED
# mysql supports READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE
# by defaut is REPEATABLE READ

useage of save point:

set autocommit=0;
start transaction;

delete from account where id = 1;
save point a;

delete from account where id = 2;

rollback to a;
