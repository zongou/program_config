This guide was tested on Redmi Note 4 MTK (Nikel) device, but most probably will work fine on other smartphones. We’ve used Linux Mint, but there’s any difference with other Linux distro. So, let’s continue and find out about how you can flash TWRP Recovery “recovery.img” file as well as install required ADB (Android Debug Bridge) drivers on Linux OS.

Flash TWRP Custom Recovery on install ADB drivers on Linux OS
First of all, we’ll need to install ADB drivers on our Linux system. Follow the steps below:

Open Terminal (Just in case, hotkey combination is Ctrl + Alt + T).
Enter the following commands one by one:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot
New check if ADB driver was installed correctly. Type the following commands to reboot ADB and send USB debugging request on your phone (don’t forget to enable USB-debugging on your phone first):
sudo adb kill-server
sudo adb start-server
Connect your phone and check the connection by typing in Terminal:
adb devices
If you see your device unique ID number, that means everything was done correctly. Now type the two following commands one-by-one (where twrp.img is the name of TWRP Custom Recovery image):
adb reboot bootloader
sudo fastboot devices
sudo fastboot flash recovery trwp.img
Wait until flashing process is completed, disconnect from PC and turn off your phone.
Now you can boot into TWRP Custom Recovery or continue using your phone.
